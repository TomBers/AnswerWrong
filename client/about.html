<h1>Answer Wrong - the Absurdist Word Game</h1>
<h2>What?</h2>
<p>The game is played from 2 perspectives :<br><br> 1) An ordinary multiple choice quiz game; choose the right answer from a selection,
  get a point everytime it is right.<br><br>The flip side <br><br>
  2) <strong>Create plausably wrong answers</strong>.  The more other players choose your wrong answer the more points you get</p>

  <h2>Why?</h2>
  <p>It occured to me that it is certain peoples jobs to create wrong answers.  In many places multiple choice question are
  a central part of assessment and amusement, and each question has to have wrong answers. It is a mix of free creativity and psycology to guess how others think!
 </p>

 <h2>Now?</h2>
<p>I have built the initial idea, I am looking for people to get involved and have some input on the idea, the design, play testing and/or the questions.
